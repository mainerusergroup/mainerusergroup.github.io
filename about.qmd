### Hello MaineRs!

The Greater Portland R User Group was initially founded in 2018 as a way to bring the R Users of Portland Maine together. With the hopes of becoming a state-wide user group, we have renamed to the MaineR Users Group.

The goal of this group is to explore and discuss R and how it is being used in data science, data analysis, visualization, data mining, predictive analytics, and beyond!

People of all levels are welcome to attend, from those just getting started with R and predictive modelling to experts using R every day. While the focus is on the R programming language, presentations / talks from other languages/ fields are more than welcome!
