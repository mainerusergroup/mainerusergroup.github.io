Donald Szlosek, Biostatistician at IDEXX, will do a demonstration of optical character recognition in R. Optical character recognition is a process through which images of typed, handwritten, or printed text are electronically converted into machine-encoded text. The tesseract package provides R bindings to Tesseract, a powerful optical character recognition (OCR) engine that supports over 100 languages. Novice and intermediate R users are encouraged to attend.
