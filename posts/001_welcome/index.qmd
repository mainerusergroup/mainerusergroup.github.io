Hello, World!

With the hopes of becoming a state-wide user group, we have renamed to the MaineR Users Group!

Our goal is to collaborate with different academic, industrial, and research organizations across the state of Maine! 

This year, we are hoping to plan **six events (one event every other month)**!
