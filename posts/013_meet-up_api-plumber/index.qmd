It's about time we get the group going again. I'll get us started by talking about a recent challenge I had - how to write reproducible tests for an API wrapper package. Enter plumber - a easy way to create an restful API endpoint in R to test against. This will be a virtual meeting hosted on zoom. RSVP to get the zoom link.
