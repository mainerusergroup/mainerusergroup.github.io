Greetings R users!\
Starting out 2020 we would like to host an R hack-a-thon. Bring your laptops and we will break into groups and hack away at a tidy tuesday dataset from this repo: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020

The most recent dataset is Measles vaccination data which might be a timely topic but you could also choose a different one as well. After \~45 minutes of hacking each group will give a \~10 minute presentation to group about what they found.
