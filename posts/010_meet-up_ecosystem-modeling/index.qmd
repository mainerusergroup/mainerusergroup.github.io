Dr. Nick Record and Ben Tupper will share some of the modeling and forecasting work they have done using citizen observations and quasi-public presence-only data. They have developed several model and forecast systems for a variety of ecological species and events including jellyfish, ticks, and moose-vehicle crashes.

Dr. Nick Record is a computational ocean ecologist and senior research scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. Nick is also director of the Colby at Bigelow Semester program.

Ben Tupper is a software developer and senior lackey at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.
