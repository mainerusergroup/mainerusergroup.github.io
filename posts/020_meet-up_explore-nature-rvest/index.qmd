Are cell biologists the most long-winded academics? How curt are physicists when describing their own research? This presentation will cover the basics of using {rvest} package to easily web scrape data from html web pages. We will be exploring how to develop a workflow to web scrap article titles from [www.nature.com](http://www.nature.com/) and to discover the insights that nature has in store for us.

Come learn about the rvest package with Donald Szlosek!
