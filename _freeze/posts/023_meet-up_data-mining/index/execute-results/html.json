Frequent dataset mining is a specific type of data mining that involves identifying frequent patterns or associations within a dataset.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n+ [arules](https://github.com/mhahsler/arules)\n+ [arulesViz](https://github.com/mhahsler/arulesViz)\n+ [cSPADE](https://github.com/zakimjz/cSPADE)\n\n\n[name](linkxxxxxx)\n\n",
