Frequent dataset mining is a specific type of data mining that involves identifying frequent patterns or associations within a dataset.\n\n[Slides](https://github.com/mainerusergroup/mainerusergroup.github.io/blob/main/posts/023_meet-up_data-mining/Frequent%20Symptom%20Mining%20Slides.pdf)\n\nUseful Links:\n\n-   [arules](https://github.com/mhahsler/arules)\n-   [arules JSS article](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v014i15)\n-   [arules JMLR article](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/hahsler11a/hahsler11a.pdf)\n-   [arulesViz](https://github.com/mhahsler/arulesViz)\n-   [cSPADE](https://github.com/zakimjz/cSPADE)\n",
